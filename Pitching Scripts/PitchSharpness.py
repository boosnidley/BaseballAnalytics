# Pitch Type	        Ideal Sharpness Range	Elite Sharpness Range	ðŸ’¬ Notes
# Fastball	            35 â€“ 55	                55 â€“ 70	                Lower sharpness is normal. Focus is on carry (IVB), not break.
# Two-Seam Fastball	    45 â€“ 60	                60 â€“ 75	                More lateral movement than 4-seam. Sharpness still moderate.
# Changeup	            70 â€“ 90	                90 â€“ 110+	            Late drop/change of direction is key. Higher sharpness = more deception.
# Slider	            70 â€“ 90	                90 â€“ 120+	            Elite sliders snap late. Sharpness >100 often equals wipeout pitches.
# Curveball	            80 â€“ 100	            100 â€“ 120+	            Big drop, often with tighter spin. Elite sharpness = true 12-6 or hammer curves.
